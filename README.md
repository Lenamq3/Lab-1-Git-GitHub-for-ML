Hi everyone! My name is Lena Alqahtani, and I’m a Computer Science student. I’m interested in machine learning because it combines problem-solving, data, and creativity to build systems that can learn and improve over time. I’m especially curious about how machine learning is applied in real-world applications like recommendation systems, data analysis, and intelligent decision-making. I’m excited to learn more throughout this course and gain hands-on experience with machine learning concepts and tools.
looking forward to learning more about machine learning in ARTI 308!
